# Positioning vs Existing Memory Frameworks

EvidenceSpine is a memory quality layer, not a full orchestration framework.

## Differentiators
1. Evidence-bound facts with explicit state lifecycle.
2. Claim-level citation coverage metrics.
3. Contradiction-aware risk surfacing in briefs.
4. Portable handoff packet format with checksum.
5. Fail-open operational model.

## Where to use it
- Teams running multiple agents (implementer/auditor/researcher).
- High-stakes domains where claim provenance matters.
- Existing stacks that need governance-grade handoffs.

## Where not to use it alone
- If you need agent orchestration, tool routing, and workflow graphs from scratch.
- Use it with LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, or your own orchestrator.
